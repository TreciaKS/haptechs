# Haptechs VR Startup
Haptechs, a virtual reality startup, needs a React-based UI for their website that they will use to announce their brand and products coming soon. They specialize in hardware and software development for virtual reality technologies and are determined to create an impressive interface that reflects their innovative spirit.

**Disclaimer:** This project was built for an interview assessment. But I adopted it as one of my side projects and will add additional features as time progresses.
